# Danicat's (Video Games) Wish List <3

Video games were a huge part of my childhood. Born in a poor, disfunctional family they were both my refuge and my best friend. 

Back in the 80's and 90's I couldn't afford the newest generation games and was always one or two generations behind. Nevertheless having those games brought me a lot of joy. 

Eventually I became a video game collector to gather all the games I couldn't afford back in the day. By 2006 I had a very nice collection with dozens of consoles and hundreds of games.

Unfortunately because of financial problems I had to sell them all and by 2012 they were all gone. :(

Now in 2020, I decided to go back to my roots and invest in my collection again. It will be a painful process in some ways, as many of the games I had now are very rare and costs hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but luckily I'm in a better position financially as well! ^_^

I've create this repo to keep track of the items I have and the ones I'm still looking for. It's mostly for my personal use, but if by any chance you have any of those items laying around please let me know :)

Also, if you want to give me a gift and don't know how, this is a good place to start! *wink* *wink* =^_^=
